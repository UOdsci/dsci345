## Description of the course

This course covers a theoretical basis in probability and statistics
that is foundational for work in data science.
Randomness and uncertainty are fundamental at all stages of data science work,
from understanding strengths and limitations of data sources,
through modeling and inference,
to algorithmic aspects of learning and prediction
(e.g., random forests; stochastic gradient decent).
This course is aimed at students who have done some work looking at real data
and want to have a deeper (and more quantitative)
understanding of what we are doing when we make predictions using data.
The course covers
both tools for modeling randomness and calculating properties of those models,
and the process of estimating quantities from data.
An important thread throughout the course is on *simulating data*:
being able to construct and simulate from sophisticated models for random data generation.


## Instructor:

- [Peter Ralph](https://pages.uoregon.edu/plr/), instructor: plr@uoregon.edu
    * office hours: Mondays, 12:30-2pm in 204 Pacific, or by appointment.

## Course Information

- *Schedule:* Mon/Wed/Fri 11:00-11:50 AM in 251 Straub and on zoom (see Canvas for link)
- *Websites:* besides [the page you are looking at](https://UOdsci.github.io/dsci345/),
    assignments and announcements will be distributed
    on the [canvas page](https://canvas.uoregon.edu/)
- *Assignments:* Assigned weekly, and due (usually) the following Tuesday.

## Prerequisites:

Students should be familiar with the basics of calculus and linear algebra,
have experience with python,
and have worked with describing/visualizing data.
UO course prerequisites:
Math 342 (linear algebra), CS 211 (computer science II), and
either DSCI 101/102 or some other exposure to data science/statistics,

## Textbooks

We will be assigning reading from these (freely available) books:

- [*Probability for Data Science*](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/README.html),
    by Ani Adhikari and Jim Pitman.

There is a list of other useful reading materials on [the page of references](reference.html).

## Software:

Class demonstrations, exercises, and homeworks
will be done using [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/),
so you should have on your computer a working python installation
with

- [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/),
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/),
- [scipy](https://scipy.org/),
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).

We will also have a jupyter hub available -
ask me for an account - but recommend that you
get this working on your own computer, if possible.


## Class structure, remote learning, and flexibility

I aim to make class available remotely,
by broadcasting lectures on zoom (see Canvas for the link)
and making the recordings available afterwards on Canvas.
However, for most students in-class participation is more engaging
and results in better learning outcomes,
so I strongly encourage in-person attendance.
However, I know that things happen in life that might make you unable to come --
for instance, please do not come to class if you are sick.

If you are unable to turn in assignments on time,
please let me know when you are able,
so I can make alternative arrangements.

## Assignments and evaluation

Course grades will be based on assignments and a final,
totaled as either 85% assignments and 15% final or 70% assignments and 30% final,
whichever is greater.
Most assignments are weekly homeworks, due the week after they are assigned.
These will be multi-part assignments done using jupyter notebooks,
that will contain writing, mathematics, and (python) code.
The contribution of each assignment to the final grade will be proportional to the points assigned,
and thresholds for letter grades are not fixed beforehand
but will be chosen to reflect:
A: "excellent, demonstrates competence in all topics and mastery of many";
B: "good, demonstrates competence in all topics";
C: "satisfactory, demonstrates competence in most topics and familiarity with all topics";
D: "less than satisfactory, demonstrates competence in some topics but not all";
F: "not satisfactory, not competent or familiar with most topics".


## Inclusion and accessibility

Please feel welcome to tell me your pronouns and name,
especially if either differs from the class roster.
I take seriously my responsibility to create inclusive learning environments.
Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this
course that result in barriers to your participation! You are also encouraged
to contact the Accessible Education Center in 164 Oregon Hall at 541-346-1155
or uoaec@uoregon.edu.

We are committed to making our classroom an inclusive and respectful learning space.
Being respectful includes using pronouns for your classmates.
Your classmates come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences;
please avoid assumptions or stereotypes, and aim for inclusivity.
Let me know if there are classroom dynamics that impede your (or someone elseâ€™s) full engagement. 

Please see [this page](policies.html) for more information on
campus resources, academic integrity, discrimination, and harassment (and reporting of it).
